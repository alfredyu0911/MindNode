# Introduction
* It can be used for graduate-school examinations of CS related departments.
* This note is only my personal learning experience, documented as a mind map, using [MindNode](https://mindnode.com/).
  * Again, this is just my personal understanding, contents in this note are not always important nor guaranteed to be 100% correct.
  * One thing I can assure is that making this note helps me to memorize, reconstruct and understand those topics.

# Usage
* For people who don't have the license of [MindNode](https://mindnode.com/), there are PDF/FreeMind/Text files available.
  * Here are some other formats ![](https://i.imgur.com/6JFMEO6.jpg), please feel free to contact me for those other formats.
  * Note that reading those notes by pure text is not recommended since some of them are images and not be able to be exported as pure text. Also those maps are constructed by a certain relation/connection, which I doubt that the exported pure text can represent the same meaning.

# Maintain
* This mind map note will not be further maintained.
